blackjack
============================================================================================

This program is a pseudo-simple Ruby Code to play Terminal Blackjack. 

You can run the file by: 
    1. Open terminal and navigate to the directory
    2. Once in the blackjack directory, enter: Ruby -Ilib /lib/blackjack.rb
*** BUGS *** 
============================================================================================    

I have fixed the following bugs. however, when I tried to push the documents to github, github.com hasn't updated. 
1. I am currently working on fixing the double value nature of Aces. 
2. I need to add blackjack into the betting.rb file as well as the player.rb file 

**NEXT** 
============================================================================================    
I will be doing some QA on the deck tomorrow. I need to make sure the program is pulling from the same deck every time. Also, I need to make sure the game shuffles the deck after it reaches the end of the deak.
