blackjack
============================================================================================

This program is a pseudo-simple Ruby Code to play Terminal Blackjack. 

You can run the file by: 
    1. Open terminal and navigate to the directory
    2. Once in the blackjack directory, enter: Ruby -Ilib /lib/blackjack.rb

*** BUGS *** 

1. I am currently working on fixing the double value nature of Aces. 
2. I need to add blackjack into the betting.rb file as well as the player.rb file
